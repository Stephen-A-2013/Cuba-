    <h2>Economy</h2>
    <p>Cuba’s economy is largely state-controlled and has faced challenges due to decades of trade embargoes and limited access to global markets. Key industries include tourism, agriculture, biotechnology, and mining. Sugar, tobacco, and coffee are major exports, with Cuban cigars being world-renowned. Tourism has become a vital source of income, attracting visitors with Cuba’s beaches, culture, and history. Despite economic hardships, Cuba has made significant investments in education and healthcare, which are free to all citizens.

  <section id="history">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Cuba’s history is marked by colonization, revolution, and transformation. Originally inhabited by indigenous Taíno people, the island was claimed by Spain in 1492 and remained under Spanish rule for centuries. The fight for independence culminated in 1902, when Cuba became a republic, although U.S. influence remained strong. In 1959, Fidel Castro led a revolutionary movement that overthrew the Batista regime, establishing a socialist government that dramatically reshaped Cuban society. The Cold War era saw Cuba align with the Soviet Union, leading to events like the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Despite decades of economic embargoes and political isolation, Cuba has maintained its sovereignty and developed a strong national identity. Today, its history is preserved in museums, architecture, and the collective memory of its people.</p>
    <p>Here is a short video to help you get a better understanding of Cuba's history:</p>

  <section id="culture">
    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <p>Cuba’s culture is a dynamic fusion of Spanish colonial heritage, African traditions, and Caribbean flair. Music and dance are deeply woven into the fabric of everyday life, with genres like salsa, rumba, and son Cubano echoing through neighborhoods and plazas. The arts are highly celebrated, with Cuban painters, poets, and performers gaining international recognition for their bold and expressive styles. Religion also plays a unique role, with Santería—a blend of Catholicism and Yoruba beliefs—being practiced alongside more mainstream faiths. Family and community are central to Cuban identity, and gatherings often involve storytelling, laughter, and shared meals. The spirit of resilience and joy shines through even in challenging times, making Cuban culture both rich and inspiring.</p>
